# Credit_Risk_ML

## Introduction
I was challenged with using Python to create and analyze machine learning models to predict credit risk. The methods that I utilized to achieve these outcomes included: <br>

- Creating training and test groups from a given data set. <br>
- Implementing the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms. <br>
- Interpreting the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms. <br>
- Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm. <br>
- Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario. <br>
- Using ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance. <br>
